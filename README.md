I am currently an engineeering undergrad studying Electronics Engineering. It would not be wrong to say that developing and coding are the two most exciting things that bring out the best in me. Give me a problem to solve and I would jump right away into solving it. The Github repos are an example of how much coding excites me. Do check out the repos. All your valuable feedbacks are always welcome!
